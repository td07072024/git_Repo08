Estrogen (British English: oestrogen; see spelling differences) is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics.[1][2] There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3).[1][3] Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent.[1] Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy.

Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates[4] and some insects.[5] Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women.[6] While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males.[7]
